# CryptoDash

## Description

Design and data-driven browser home page web app and chrome extension to track onchain identity, crypto metrics in a local-first private by default model. Free version allows you to bring your own API keys, or there is a paid annual plan that rate limited includes access to shared API keys.

## Problem Statement

For people that want to keep an eye on the markets and onchain environment throughout the day without being glued to charts. Also acts as a producivity dashboard for onchain activities.

## Goals 

- Local-First app hosted on IPFS with PWA for Offline Mode
- Connect wallet to log in and load connected address that persists between sessions
- Centralised gateway that securely holds API keys for premium plan

## Anti-Goals
- No custody of funds or private keys. This is not a wallet. 
- No heavy server database. 
- No onchain actions beyond SIWE and optional subscripion payment

## Technical Design

- Maybe SvelteKit + Tailwind
- Local caching of calls with logical refresh rates
- Some lightweight way to manage subscriptions and access

## Potential MCP Prompts

- Identify all chains logged in address is active on and total assets
- Identify all chains logged in address is active on and then weight volume percentages
- Identify chains user is active on with lots of activity


## Vendors

- Blockscout SDK and MCP (Required for hackathon entry)
- Pyth for onchain prices (Optional for Hackathon)
- HyperSync (Optional for hackathon) - Provides real time streaming data. Thinking this could be used to create generative art and graphics to beautify the dashboard driven by onchain data. Think shapes and sizes driven by transaction types and velocity etc. 
- Alchemy API/RPC (Available)
- OpenSea MCP Acccess (Available)
- Nansen MCP Access (Available) 
- Snapshot (Considering for bringing in governance options, i.e. see available votes)

### Best use of Blockscout MCP (Vibecode an app OR create a great prompt) â¸º $3,500
1st place App | 1st place Prompt $1,250 Ã—2
2nd place App | 2nd place Prompt $500 Ã—2
Use Blockscout's MCP in various contexts to either Vibecode an app OR create a super prompt that helps with blockchain analysis.
1) Vibe Code an app with Blockscout!
Use Blockscoutâ€™s MCP when creating your blockchain app. The MCP has multichain coverage and includes data on balances, tokens, NFTs and contract metadata.Hook up the MCP to your preferred LLM and start finding contextual insights and incorporating these into your application.
Example Ideas
- App that tracks token balances across various lending protocols
- An apple watch app that alerts you of whale purchases of certain tokens on different chains
- App that displays transaction counts or other usage stats across multiple chains and timeframes.
2) Create a super prompt with Blockscout MCP for comprehensive blockchain analyses.
Develop a prompt (for ChatGPT, Claude etc) that allows us to dig deep into blockchain data. We've developed some simple prompts like "Tell me about a specific transaction, or show me token approvals for this address", but we haven't developed many in-depth prompts yet. That's where you come in!
We're looking for prompts that provide a full-account analysis, chain-of-custody research or other in-depth analysis. We should be able to run your reusable prompts in ChatGPT/Claude to get similar results for different accounts, transactions, or user operations.
Qualification Requirements
App prizes will be awarded based on overall idea, creativity, and interactivity with blockchain data via Blockscout.
Prompt prizes will be awarded based on their generalizability, usefulness, and ability to produce impressive results with the MCP server.
